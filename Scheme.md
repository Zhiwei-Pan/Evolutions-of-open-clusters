# Open Cluster evolution



## Scientific Purpose

study the structure and evolution of the Milky Way

get the most astrophysical properties of open clusters

## Advantages

3000 open clusters ->statics

Gaia: 5 astrometric solutions and 3 photometry bands, easily determine cluster members

TOPCAT: easy to crosshatch, e.g. 2MASS

## Process 

1. reproduce what Tadross et al. 2018 did with Dolidze 41
2. download all the Gaia cluster data base on the Dias et al. 2002 catalog
3. write a simple pipeline to do data reduction for each cluster
4. simply plot everything v.s. time 
5. try best to find other evolution properties.
